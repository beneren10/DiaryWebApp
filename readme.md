# Welcome to Diary A Day

## Make a note of your good days, and reflect on your not so good days. 

### Bug list 

- When creating a post it renders the HTML element but its id isnt linked to the DB, so it is not editable, and getting all will check the list for id and because it has no id it will pull the replica entry from the database.

- search function not working

- no page size limit, need to add max 1 page worth of entries.

- the default diary entry isnt clear enough that its a example.
